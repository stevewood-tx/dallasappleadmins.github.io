title: Next Dallas Admin Meetup
---

Mark your calendar, we have scheduled our next meetup of the Dallas Apple Admins for the third Thursday of May, May 17, 2018, from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm. Bottle Rocket Studios has agreed once again to host us. We will have pizza, soda, and water, and perhaps a presentation or two from some vendors.

So come on out and join us and engage with some fellow Mac admins around the area. Head on over to Jamf Nation to register:

**_Note: this is not a Jamf only event. We often never discuss Jamf products at all and instead focus on topics that will help all admins, whether you use Jamf, Munki, or some other management toolkit._**
