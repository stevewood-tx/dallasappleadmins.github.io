Happy Holidays! It's been far too long since our last "gathering" so we're throwing one on the calendar. Join us Wednesday December 14, 2022 at 12 pm CST for a social meet-up over zoom. We will have an open mic session to throw questions around and we'll have a conversation about a potential in-person meetup in early 2023.
