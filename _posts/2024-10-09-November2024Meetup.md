Come join us on Thursday November 7, 2024 for our next in-person meetup. We haven't met since February of this year and I'm sure we're all eager to share what's new in our environments. Come out to Toyota Connected in Plano to share some pizza, some drinks, and what's going on in your world. A presentation is possible, and maybe even some swag. So come out, spend an evening with fellow Apple admins, and make some new friends!
