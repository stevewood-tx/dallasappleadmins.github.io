Where's all the stuffs? You may have noticed that all of the older meetup posts are gone and that only this post and our announcement of the Cinco de Mayo virtual meetup
are left. Well, long story short, I messed up the site while trying to emulate the [Houston Apple Admins site](https://houstonappleadmins.org).

What can I say, I'm not much of a web developer, definitely not much of a designer, and, well, it got messy. So I found this Jekyll template and just started fresh.

So, for now you have the post announcing the meetup from this week, and shortly I'll get a recap post up about the meetup (***hint: it was pretty awesome!***).

In the meantime, if you want to see some other sites, go visit some of the other Texas admin sites:
