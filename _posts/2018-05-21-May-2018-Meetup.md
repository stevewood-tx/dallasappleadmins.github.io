We had a great turnout for our May meetup. We were joined by several new faces and a face we haven't seen around in a while. Conversation ranged from job opportunities to how to use [Nibbler](https://github.com/pudquick/nibbler). It was great fun had by all with plenty of pizza to go around.

Plan on joining us for our next meetup in July. Details and dates to come soon.
