We had a few new faces join us this last time. Thank you for joining us fellas and we hope to see you at our next meetup.

Joel Rennich ([MacTroll](https://twitter.com/mactroll)) joined us via Zoom video to discuss the recent announcement of [Jamf's](https://www.jamf.com) purchase of Joel's company Orchard & Grove and the rebranding of their NoMAD Pro line of apps to "[Jamf Connect](https://www.jamf.com)".

We spent the rest of the evening mulling over [TCC](https://tcc.url.com) and it's implications in our environments, Microsoft's release of Office 2019 and the implications around their N-2 support, and finally we chatted about macOS Mojave and the changes (besides TCC) that it brings.

Our next meetup will be Thursday November 15th at the same Bat time and on the same Bat channel. Look for a post with the particulars soon.
