It's a strange time right now, what with everyone locked down due to Covid-19, so we're going to do something out of the ordinary. The coordinators for the various Mac admin meetups in Texas have gotten together and we're going to host a "Virtual Texas Mac Admin Meetup"!

The date will be Tuesday May 5th (why not celebrate Cinco de Mayo too?) and we'll be holding the meetup during the lunch hour, from 12 pm to 1 pm.

Stay tuned to this blog, the Houston Mac Admins blog, the Austin Mac Admins blog, or to any of the city channels or the state channel in Slack! We'll post more details, including a WebEx link, as the time gets closer.

We'll have some lightning talks and we'll try to have a little time for socializing as best we can over a WebEx.

We're all looking forward to it!

Stay safe and stay healthy!
