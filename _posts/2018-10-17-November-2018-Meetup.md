We had a full house (for us) in November. A couple of new faces, including representation from [Filewave](https://www.filewave.com). Thanks Avery for joining us.

As usual, we ate a bunch of pizza and had some great discussions around the iPhone XR and iPhone XS (Are you an XS or an XS Max fan?). We re-capped some of the discussions from JNUC,
and had a bit of a discussion around what appears to be a bug in Apple's Security Update 2018-002 for High Sierra ([Security Update 2018-001 High Sierra or Security Update 2018-002 High Sierra](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/29987/security-update-2018-001-high-sierra-or-security-update-2018-002-high-sierra)).

We will not have another meet-up until 2019.

Have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
