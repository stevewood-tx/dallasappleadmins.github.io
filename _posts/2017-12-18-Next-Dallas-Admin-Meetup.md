Hey everyone, we have scheduled our next meetup of the Dallas Apple Admins for the third Thursday of January, January 18, 2018, from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm. Bottle Rocket Studios has agreed once again to host us. We will have pizza, soda, and water, and perhaps a presentation or two from some vendors.

So come on out and join us and engage with some fellow Mac admins around the area.
