# Dallas Apple Admins 

Our desire is to unite the Apple admins from the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex and to provide a safe environment for the sharing of knowledge, expanding the Mac admin community, and helping to provide professional development to fellow admins.

### Meetups

Every 1-2 months, we organize and coordinate a meetup where we can gather to discuss the hot topics in the Mac community, and eat some pizza. Our past sponsors have been:

* [Jamf Software](http://www.jamfsoftware.com/)
* [Filewave](https://www.filewave.com)
* [BottleRocket Studios](https://www.bottlerocketstudios.com)

### Speaking & Hosting

We are always open to adding more hosts, sponsors, and presenters to our community. 

If you or your organization would like to sponsor an event, please email [steve@wood-family.net](mailto:steve@wood-family.net).

If you would like to present at a future meetup, please email  [steve@wood-family.net](mailto:steve@wood-family.net).
