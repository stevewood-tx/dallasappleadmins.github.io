# Austin Apple Admins 

<img src="/assets/images/aaa.png" alt="Austin Apple Admins" style="width: 200px;align: center;" />

Our goal is simple: to create a social network of Apple admins in and around Austin and Central Texas. We continually strive for this network to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, the ability to grow and learn, to foster professional development, bolster camaraderie amongst peers, and have some fun along the way.

### Social Media

We share information and connect with our colleagues using the following social networks:

* Twitter: [https://twitter.com/austinappleadmn](https://twitter.com/austinappleadmn)
* Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/austinappleadmins](https://www.facebook.com/austinappleadmins)
* LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6974270](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6974270)
* Slack: [https://macadmins.slack.com/archives/austin](https://macadmins.slack.com/archives/austin)
* Google Calendar: [https://goo.gl/WwYdQ2](https://goo.gl/WwYdQ2)
* TinyLetter: [https://www.tinyletter.com/austinappleadmins](https://www.tinyletter.com/austinappleadmins)

### Meetups

Every 1-2 months, we organize and coordinate a meetup involving 1-2 presenters and sponsors that provide both a meeting space and/or food and beverage. Past sponsors include:

* [Jamf Software](http://www.jamfsoftware.com/)
* [Business Team, The Domain Apple Store](http://www.apple.com/retail/thedomain/)
* [HomeAway](http://www.homeaway.com/)
* [Trusource Labs](http://www.trusourcelabs.com/)
* [ChaiOne](https://chaione.com/)
* [Favor Austin](http://favordelivery.com)

### Happy Hours and Social Events

Periodically we organize happy hours or general social outings so that members of the community can socialize and commiserate without involving a more formal presentation-style meeting. Past venues include:

* [Punch Bowl Social](http://www.punchbowlsocial.com/location/austin)
* [The Beer Plant](http://www.thebeerplant.com)
* [Fado Austin](http://www.fadoirishpub.com/austin/)
* [Geeks Who Drink](http://www.geekswhodrink.com/venue?id=199270)
* [Mean-Eyed Cat](http://themeaneyedcat.com/)
* [Black Star Co-op](http://www.blackstar.coop/)
